# EasyAdmin Enhancements

## User Management Interface Improvements

### Order Count Display

**Implementation Date**: August 2025

**Purpose**: Replace the "Nouveau mot de passe" (New Password) field in the EasyAdmin user list with a more meaningful "Commandes réussies" (Successful Orders) field that displays the count of paid orders for each user.

### Technical Details

#### Files Modified:

1. **src/Controller/Admin/UserCrudController.php**
   - Added `OrderRepository` dependency injection
   - Modified `configureFields()` method to:
     - Remove password field from index view
     - Add custom `IntegerField` for order count with custom template
   - Added AJAX endpoint `/admin/user/{id}/orders-count` to fetch order counts

2. **templates/admin/field/orders_count.html.twig**
   - Custom template for displaying order count
   - Uses Bootstrap badge with dynamic loading
   - Implements AJAX call to fetch actual count
   - Handles loading states and error cases

#### Features:

- **Performance Optimized**: Uses AJAX loading to avoid N+1 queries on the user list page
- **User-Friendly Display**: Shows order count in a blue badge format
- **Loading States**: Displays "..." while loading and "Erreur" if the request fails
- **Business Relevant**: Replaces technical password field with meaningful business data

#### Query Logic:

The order count includes orders that match EITHER:
- `o.user = :user` (logged-in user orders)
- `o.email = :email` (guest orders with same email)

AND have status `'paid'` (only successful orders are counted).

### Usage:

1. Navigate to `/admin` and access the "Users" section
2. The user list now shows "Commandes réussies" instead of "Nouveau mot de passe"
3. Each user row displays their successful order count as a badge
4. Counts are loaded dynamically for better performance

### Benefits:

- **Better UX**: Administrators see immediately relevant business information
- **Security**: Removes password-related fields from the interface
- **Performance**: Efficient AJAX loading prevents database overload
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns with custom templates

### Future Enhancements:

- Add order amount totals alongside count
- Implement caching for frequently accessed user order data
- Add click-through to view user's order details
